# Fizz-Buzz
Created by Muganga Eric

This code is an implementation of the Fizz Buzz problem. The Fizz Buzz problem is a popular programming problem that requires a program to print numbers from 1 to N, where N is an integer provided by the user. For each number, if the number is divisible by 3, the program should print "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, the program should print "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program should print "Fizz Buzz". If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, the program should print the number itself.

The code starts with two Console.WriteLine statements that print out "Hello, World!" and "Welcome to the Fizz Buzz Program". Then, the user is prompted to enter an integer value using Console.Write and Console.ReadLine statements.

The value entered by the user is stored in the variable n, which is then passed as an argument to the FizzBuzz method.

The FizzBuzz method takes an integer n as an input parameter and implements a loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to n. For each number i, the method uses if-else statements to check if i is divisible by 3, 5, both 3 and 5, or neither 3 nor 5. Depending on the divisibility, the method prints out "Fizz", "Buzz", "Fizz Buzz", or the number itself using Console.WriteLine statements.

Overall, this code implements the Fizz Buzz problem and provides a simple way for users to interactively enter an integer value and view the Fizz Buzz output.
